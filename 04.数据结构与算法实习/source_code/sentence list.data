checkmd is a linux unix bash script that calculates the md checksum of a file and compares it to an original either by selecting an original copy of the file or manually entering the checksum of the original file such as when it is provided on a website from which you downloaded a file the purpose of this project was not just to tell you what the checksum is but to quickly compare it to an original and give you a go or no go status so you don t have to manually spend time comparing the two checksums character by character so you can verify that a file is or isn t good and move on to more important things in your life the script depends on the programs md sum and zenity which come standard in most flavors of linux or unix it may also run in osx since bash is available and it runs on a bsd nix kernel but i don t have access to an apple computer to test this for more information reference the readme file inside the archive

metrix is the platform to collect and analyse code metrics it has got plugin based architecture so it is easy to add support for new languages and or define new metrics and or create new pre and post processing tools every metric has got turn on and other configuration options there is no predefined thresholds for metrics or rules you can choose and configure any limit you want it scales well to big code bases for example initial parsing of about files takes minutes on average pc and only seconds for iterative re run reporting of summary result and exceeded limits is less than seconds it can compare results for code snapshots collections and differentiate added regions classes functions etc modified regions and unchanged regions as a result easy deployment is guaranteed into legacy software helping you to enforce leave it not worse than before or leave it re factored rule

this is a task scheduler which has no built in functionality it is more of a platform to code your own tasks it is designed on the structure of when if do which i have translated into triggers conditions and actions so when building tasks you first create definitions of the triggers conditions and actions this program gives you the ability to code up a form for each definition which would pass parameters to the trigger condition or action itself allowing the user to define their own parameters on task creation after the definitions have been coded up there is no longer a need of any coding knowledge allowing regular users to make use of this program you can simply create a task where you would mix and match the definitions so the task behaves the way you intended the definitions tasks can separately be exported imported between clients allowing the more knowledgeable users to create libraries of definitions or tasks

almost all freely available scientific softwares suffer from lack of an appropriate graphical user interface namd is a parallel molecular dynamics code for large biomolecular systems although the namd graphical interface plug in for vmd provides an easy to use interface for setting up common namd simulation jobs but in the case of analyzing the results and converting textual outputs to more useful graphical representations we do not have a complete solution browsing the web reveals that apart from some log file parsers there is no suitable gui based analyzing tool the main target of namdview is providing a gui based analyzing and visualization tool for namd output files such as log file free energy calculation output files and etc

hibersap helps developers of java applications to call business logic in sap backends it defines a set of java annotations to map sap function modules to java classes as well as a small clean api to execute these function modules and handle transaction and security aspects hibersap s programming model is quite similar to those of modern o r mappers significantly speeding up the development of sap interfaces and making it much more fun to write the integration code under the hood hibersap either uses the sap java connector jco or a jca compatible resource adapter to communicate with the sap backend while retaining the benefits of jco and jca like transactions security connection pooling etc developers can focus on writing business logic because the need for boilerplate code is largely reduced

the wittgen programming language consists of just two instructions and one special variable name wittgen allows you to assign any text string to a variable of any name it also allows you to retrieve the text assigned to that variable lastly it has a special variable called doing now every execution step consists of retrieving the contents of doing now removing the first assign found in that content and performing that assign in the course of performing that assign any retrieve operations indicated in the text are performed before committing the assign that is all there the system does the driving motivation for this design is that as far as we know the human mind supports these two instructions it may have additional mechanisms that create new assigns but using the results of these mechanisms requires a system built from these instructions

gerbil consists of an interactive visualization tool targeted at multispectral and hyperspectral image data and a toolbox of common algorithms e g for segmentation multispectral imaging has been gaining popularity and has been gradually applied to many fields besides remote sensing however due to the high dimensionality of the data both human observers and computers have difficulty interpreting this wealth of information gerbil facilitates the visualization of the relationship between spectral and topological information in a novel fashion it puts emphasis on the spectral gradient which is shown to provide enhanced information for many reflectance analysis tasks it also includes a rich toolbox for evaluation of image segmentation and other algorithms in the multispectral domain the parallel coordinates visualization technique is combined with hashing for a highly interactive visual connection between spectral distribution spectral gradient and topology
