Project for Computer Vision and Deep Learning

This project was written on Linux system and run on the cluster belonging to Sensetime.

In nature, it is only a copy of [an unofficial implementation](https://github.com/ranjaykrishna/SST) of a paper, [SST](http://vision.stanford.edu/pdf/buch2017cvpr.pdf), while [offical implementation](https://github.com/shyamal-b/sst) was released later. 

And sadly, we didn't get any result in the end.
